Provides <i>p</i> value and effect size to check if there is a statistically significant difference and how strong any measurable effect is. Examples include: comparing the number of males and females that answered either "yes" or "no" to a survey question, comparing whether or not speakers of one langauge used / didn't use a linguistc feature more than speakers of another langauge, etc.</div>
