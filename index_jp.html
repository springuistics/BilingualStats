            <div id="two_comps_hover" class="hover_text">Provides p values and effect sizes to check if there is a statistically significant difference and how strong any measurable effect is. Also helps you to choose the proper test and report it correctly in an academic paper. Examples include: pre/post comparison, comparing two different groups, comparing differences in two survey questions, etc.</div>

Also helps you to choose the proper test and report it correctly in an academic paper. Requires two measurements from the same population sample (i.e. from the same participants). Examples include: checking for relationship between survey question and learning outcome, checking for relationship between two learning outcomes, checking for relationship between two features of the participants, etc.</div>

Examples include: comparing three or more different groups, comparing progress of students at multiple points in time, comparing differences in multiple survey questions, etc.</div>

Also helps you to choose the proper test and report it correctly in an academic paper. Requires several measurements from the same population sample (i.e. from the same participants). Examples include: checking for relationship between multiple survey questions and a single learning outcome, checking for relationship between several measurements on a single learning outcomes, etc.</div>
